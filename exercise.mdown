Make a test file and play with it using as many assert methods as possible.

You can test built-in methods and functionalities. Use each assert method at least once.

For example,

    def test_string_concatanation_and_asterisk_method
      assert_equal("TDD", "T" + "D"*2)
    end

You should have something like “test\_lesson02\_05.rb” file. Post your code here.
