# Part 5


Here is a file that has every assert method included (“test\_lesson\_02\_05.rb”). Try running the file. Again see and understand the output.

In the next section we are going to cover some of the methods in details. In particular:


* What’s the difference between "equal" and "same"?
* What does "match" mean?
* What are "throw" and "raise"?
* What’s flunk()?


See you in the next section.
